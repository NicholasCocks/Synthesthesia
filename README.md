# Draw-Me-Oscillascope
Welcome to the Draw-Me-Oscillascope wiki!

## Background!
An oscilloscope's is an instrument who's primary function is to provide a graph of a signal's voltage over time. 

## Functionality & MVP
With Draw-Me-Oscillascope, users will be able to:

Free-draw onto a board (graph). The x-axis corresponding to the left audio channel's volume and the y-axis corresponding to the right channel's volume.
A frequency analyzer to show the waveform they're drawing.

In addition this project will include:
A brief introduction to the Fourier Transform used to convert coordinates to sound. 
A production README.

Wireframe
The center of the app will be the drawing plane. Will additional controls to the side of the app.
